Eight TypeScript examples of interfaces for both static side and instance side of a class.

A static property cannot be defined on an interface in TypeScript. There are three topics about it:

- Is it necessary in the first place? When do you need it?
- How it should be if it is added to the language specification?

This article deals with the first topic.
